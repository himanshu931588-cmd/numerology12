This project was developed by **Himanshu Mishra** to provide a simple yet insightful tool for those interested in numerology and self-discovery.

- **Master Number Support:** Detects and handles Master Numbers like 11 and 22.

## 📖 How it Works
The app uses the standard numerology reduction method:
1. It reduces the **Day**, **Month**, and **Year** of birth to single digits (or Master Numbers).
2. It sums those values and reduces them again to find the final Life Path.
